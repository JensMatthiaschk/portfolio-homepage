With code I can write my own scripts with immediate results on screen which hopefully make a positive impact and help people. I always strive for the balance between intuitive yet beautifully designed interfaces while simultaneously maximizing performance and scalebility on my applications. I'm naturally curious and am working continuously on improving myself to become a better developer on whom people and businesses can rely.",
